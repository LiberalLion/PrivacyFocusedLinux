# PrivacyFocusedLinux

An Ubuntu-Minimal script which keeps privacy and security in mind. Fully open-sourced and well-explained.
This script was created by Zethius 'Skengman' Redacted using Python3. It automates the rather long and tedious process of enhancing privacy in this well used distribution by newcommers and veterans alike who care about their privacy and security online.
